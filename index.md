My name is Justin Ross and I'm a new graduate from SUNY Oswego with a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a Computer 
Science minor at SUNY Oswego. I am interested in working in digital design, firmware, and embedded systems.

In my free time, I like to research and work on personal projects. I've just begun researching a wireless plant notification system. I 
want my plants to send me email notifications that remind me to water them whenever they get too dry. I also like spending time with my 
wonderful girlfriend, Hannah, and cooking.

On this site, you can find a list of courses that I have taken, a list of projects that I've done with some short descriptions 
of each, my résumé, my CV, and a nifty little contact me page.
