My name is Justin Ross and I'm an Electrical and Computer Engineering major with a Computer Science minor at SUNY Oswego. 
I will be graduating in December of 2018. I work as a Peer Tutor and a Networking Assistant, and I've worked in two 
different research labs while in school. This year I am working on my Senior Capstone Design project, which is going to be a 
walking robot. My team and I are interested in a hexapod design that can be wirelessly controlled. 

Outside of school, I'm interested in learning more about renewable energy and low power technologies. I, like many others, have
 concerns about the impact that we are having on our environment. I'm really looking forward to getting an electric car. I love my 
old Jeep, but it's a major gas guzzler and it's really not economical. 

On this site, you can find a list of courses that I have taken and am currently taking, a list of projects that I've done with some short descriptions 
of each, my résumé, my CV, and a nifty little contact me page.
